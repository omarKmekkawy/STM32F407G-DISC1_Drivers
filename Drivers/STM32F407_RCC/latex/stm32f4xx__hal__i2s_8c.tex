                 ##### How to use this driver #####
===============================================================================
[..]
   The I2S HAL driver can be used as follow:
   
   (#) Declare a I2S_HandleTypeDef handle structure.
   (#) Initialize the I2S low level resources by implement the HAL_I2S_MspInit() API:
       (##) Enable the SPIx interface clock.                      
       (##) I2S pins configuration:
           (+++) Enable the clock for the I2S GPIOs.
           (+++) Configure these I2S pins as alternate function pull-up.
       (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_I2S_Transmit_IT()
            and HAL_I2S_Receive_IT() APIs).
           (+++) Configure the I2Sx interrupt priority.
           (+++) Enable the NVIC I2S IRQ handle.
       (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_I2S_Transmit_DMA()
            and HAL_I2S_Receive_DMA() APIs:
           (+++) Declare a DMA handle structure for the Tx/Rx stream.
           (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock.
           (+++) Configure the declared DMA handle structure with the required Tx/Rx parameters.
           (+++) Configure the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.
           (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the I2S DMA Tx/Rx handle.
           (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on the 
               DMA Tx/Rx Stream.
 
  (#) Program the Mode, Standard, Data Format, MCLK Output, Audio frequency and Polarity
      using HAL_I2S_Init() function.

  -@- The specific I2S interrupts (Transmission complete interrupt, 
      RXNE interrupt and Error Interrupts) will be managed using the macros
      __I2S_ENABLE_IT() and __I2S_DISABLE_IT() inside the transmit and receive process.
  -@- Make sure that either:
       (+@) I2S PLL is configured or 
       (+@) External clock source is configured after setting correctly 
            the define constant EXTERNAL_CLOCK_VALUE in the stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h file. 
            
  (#) Three operation modes are available within this driver :
 
  *** Polling mode IO operation ***
  =================================
  [..]    
    (+) Send an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_I2S_Transmit() 
    (+) Receive an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_I2S_Receive()
  
  *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***
  ===================================
  [..]    
    (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_I2S_Transmit_IT() 
    (+) At transmission end of half transfer HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback 
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback
    (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_I2S_Receive_IT() 
    (+) At reception end of half transfer HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback 
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback
    (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_I2S_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_ErrorCallback

  *** DMA mode IO operation ***
  ==============================
  [..] 
    (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_I2S_Transmit_DMA() 
    (+) At transmission end of half transfer HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback 
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback
    (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_I2S_Receive_DMA() 
    (+) At reception end of half transfer HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback 
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback
    (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_I2S_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_ErrorCallback
    (+) Pause the DMA Transfer using HAL_I2S_DMAPause()
    (+) Resume the DMA Transfer using HAL_I2S_DMAResume()
    (+) Stop the DMA Transfer using HAL_I2S_DMAStop()

  *** I2S HAL driver macros list ***
  =============================================
  [..]
    Below the list of most used macros in USART HAL driver.
      
     (+) __HAL_I2S_ENABLE: Enable the specified SPI peripheral (in I2S mode) 
     (+) __HAL_I2S_DISABLE: Disable the specified SPI peripheral (in I2S mode)
     (+) __HAL_I2S_ENABLE_IT : Enable the specified I2S interrupts
     (+) __HAL_I2S_DISABLE_IT : Disable the specified I2S interrupts
     (+) __HAL_I2S_GET_FLAG: Check whether the specified I2S flag is set or not

   [..]
