                       ##### How to use this driver #####
===============================================================================
   [..]
   The CEC HAL driver can be used as follow:
   
   (#) Declare a CEC_HandleTypeDef handle structure.
   (#) Initialize the CEC low level resources by implementing the HAL_CEC_MspInit ()API:
       (##) Enable the CEC interface clock.
       (##) CEC pins configuration:
           (+) Enable the clock for the CEC GPIOs.
           (+) Configure these CEC pins as alternate function pull-up.
       (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_CEC_Transmit_IT()
            and HAL_CEC_Receive_IT() APIs):
           (+) Configure the CEC interrupt priority.
           (+) Enable the NVIC CEC IRQ handle.
           (@) The specific CEC interrupts (Transmission complete interrupt, 
               RXNE interrupt and Error Interrupts) will be managed using the macros
               __HAL_CEC_ENABLE_IT() and __HAL_CEC_DISABLE_IT() inside the transmit 
               and receive process.

   (#) Program the Signal Free Time (SFT) and SFT option, Tolerance, reception stop in
       in case of Bit Rising Error, Error-Bit generation conditions, device logical
       address and Listen mode in the hcec Init structure.

   (#) Initialize the CEC registers by calling the HAL_CEC_Init() API.
       
   (@) This API (HAL_CEC_Init()) configures also the low level Hardware GPIO, CLOCK, CORTEX...etc)
       by calling the customed HAL_CEC_MspInit() API.\end{DoxyVerb}
