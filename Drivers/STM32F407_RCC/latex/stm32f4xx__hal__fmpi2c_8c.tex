\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
  The FMPI2C HAL driver can be used as follows:

  (#) Declare a FMPI2C_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
      FMPI2C_HandleTypeDef  hfmpi2c;

  (#)Initialize the FMPI2C low level resources by implementing the HAL_FMPI2C_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the FMPI2Cx interface clock
      (##) FMPI2C pins configuration
          (+++) Enable the clock for the FMPI2C GPIOs
          (+++) Configure FMPI2C pins as alternate function open-drain
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
          (+++) Configure the FMPI2Cx interrupt priority
          (+++) Enable the NVIC FMPI2C IRQ Channel
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
          (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for the transmit or receive channel
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using
          (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx or Rx channel
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the hfmpi2c DMA Tx or Rx handle
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on
                the DMA Tx or Rx channel

  (#) Configure the Communication Clock Timing, Own Address1, Master Addressing mode, Dual Addressing mode,
      Own Address2, Own Address2 Mask, General call and Nostretch mode in the hfmpi2c Init structure.

  (#) Initialize the FMPI2C registers by calling the HAL_FMPI2C_Init(), configures also the low level Hardware
      (GPIO, CLOCK, NVIC...etc) by calling the customized HAL_FMPI2C_MspInit(&hfmpi2c) API.

  (#) To check if target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_FMPI2C_IsDeviceReady()

  (#) For FMPI2C IO and IO MEM operations, three operation modes are available within this driver :
