\begin{DoxyVerb}===============================================================================
                       ##### How to use this driver #####
===============================================================================
 [..]
   *** Initialization ***
   ======================
   [..]
     (#) As prerequisite, fill in the HAL_QSPI_MspInit() :
       (++) Enable QuadSPI clock interface with __HAL_RCC_QSPI_CLK_ENABLE().
       (++) Reset QuadSPI IP with __HAL_RCC_QSPI_FORCE_RESET() and __HAL_RCC_QSPI_RELEASE_RESET().
       (++) Enable the clocks for the QuadSPI GPIOS with __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE().
       (++) Configure these QuadSPI pins in alternate mode using HAL_GPIO_Init().
       (++) If interrupt mode is used, enable and configure QuadSPI global
           interrupt with HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() and HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ().
       (++) If DMA mode is used, enable the clocks for the QuadSPI DMA channel 
           with __HAL_RCC_DMAx_CLK_ENABLE(), configure DMA with HAL_DMA_Init(), 
           link it with QuadSPI handle using __HAL_LINKDMA(), enable and configure 
           DMA channel global interrupt with HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() and HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ().
     (#) Configure the flash size, the clock prescaler, the fifo threshold, the
         clock mode, the sample shifting and the CS high time using the HAL_QSPI_Init() function.

   *** Indirect functional mode ***
   ================================
   [..]
     (#) Configure the command sequence using the HAL_QSPI_Command() or HAL_QSPI_Command_IT() 
         functions :
        (++) Instruction phase : the mode used and if present the instruction opcode.
        (++) Address phase : the mode used and if present the size and the address value.
        (++) Alternate-bytes phase : the mode used and if present the size and the alternate 
            bytes values.
        (++) Dummy-cycles phase : the number of dummy cycles (mode used is same as data phase).
        (++) Data phase : the mode used and if present the number of bytes.
        (++) Double Data Rate (DDR) mode : the activation (or not) of this mode and the delay 
            if activated.
        (++) Sending Instruction Only Once (SIOO) mode : the activation (or not) of this mode.
     (#) If no data is required for the command, it is sent directly to the memory :
        (++) In polling mode, the output of the function is done when the transfer is complete.
        (++) In interrupt mode, HAL_QSPI_CmdCpltCallback() will be called when the transfer is complete.
     (#) For the indirect write mode, use HAL_QSPI_Transmit(), HAL_QSPI_Transmit_DMA() or 
         HAL_QSPI_Transmit_IT() after the command configuration :
        (++) In polling mode, the output of the function is done when the transfer is complete.
        (++) In interrupt mode, HAL_QSPI_FifoThresholdCallback() will be called when the fifo threshold 
            is reached and HAL_QSPI_TxCpltCallback() will be called when the transfer is complete.
        (++) In DMA mode, HAL_QSPI_TxHalfCpltCallback() will be called at the half transfer and 
            HAL_QSPI_TxCpltCallback() will be called when the transfer is complete.
     (#) For the indirect read mode, use HAL_QSPI_Receive(), HAL_QSPI_Receive_DMA() or 
         HAL_QSPI_Receive_IT() after the command configuration :
        (++) In polling mode, the output of the function is done when the transfer is complete.
        (++) In interrupt mode, HAL_QSPI_FifoThresholdCallback() will be called when the fifo threshold 
            is reached and HAL_QSPI_RxCpltCallback() will be called when the transfer is complete.
        (++) In DMA mode, HAL_QSPI_RxHalfCpltCallback() will be called at the half transfer and 
            HAL_QSPI_RxCpltCallback() will be called when the transfer is complete.

   *** Auto-polling functional mode ***
   ====================================
   [..]
     (#) Configure the command sequence and the auto-polling functional mode using the 
         HAL_QSPI_AutoPolling() or HAL_QSPI_AutoPolling_IT() functions :
        (++) Instruction phase : the mode used and if present the instruction opcode.
        (++) Address phase : the mode used and if present the size and the address value.
        (++) Alternate-bytes phase : the mode used and if present the size and the alternate 
            bytes values.
        (++) Dummy-cycles phase : the number of dummy cycles (mode used is same as data phase).
        (++) Data phase : the mode used.
        (++) Double Data Rate (DDR) mode : the activation (or not) of this mode and the delay 
            if activated.
        (++) Sending Instruction Only Once (SIOO) mode : the activation (or not) of this mode.
        (++) The size of the status bytes, the match value, the mask used, the match mode (OR/AND),
            the polling interval and the automatic stop activation.
     (#) After the configuration :
        (++) In polling mode, the output of the function is done when the status match is reached. The
            automatic stop is activated to avoid an infinite loop.
        (++) In interrupt mode, HAL_QSPI_StatusMatchCallback() will be called each time the status match is reached.

   *** Memory-mapped functional mode ***
   =====================================
   [..]
     (#) Configure the command sequence and the memory-mapped functional mode using the 
         HAL_QSPI_MemoryMapped() functions :
        (++) Instruction phase : the mode used and if present the instruction opcode.
        (++) Address phase : the mode used and the size.
        (++) Alternate-bytes phase : the mode used and if present the size and the alternate 
            bytes values.
        (++) Dummy-cycles phase : the number of dummy cycles (mode used is same as data phase).
        (++) Data phase : the mode used.
        (++) Double Data Rate (DDR) mode : the activation (or not) of this mode and the delay 
            if activated.
        (++) Sending Instruction Only Once (SIOO) mode : the activation (or not) of this mode.
        (++) The timeout activation and the timeout period.
     (#) After the configuration, the QuadSPI will be used as soon as an access on the AHB is done on 
         the address range. HAL_QSPI_TimeOutCallback() will be called when the timeout expires.

   *** Errors management and abort functionality ***
   ==================================================
   [..]
     (#) HAL_QSPI_GetError() function gives the error raised during the last operation.
     (#) HAL_QSPI_Abort() and HAL_QSPI_AbortIT() functions aborts any on-going operation and 
         flushes the fifo :
        (++) In polling mode, the output of the function is done when the transfer 
             complete bit is set and the busy bit cleared.
        (++) In interrupt mode, HAL_QSPI_AbortCpltCallback() will be called when 
             the transfer complete bi is set.

   *** Control functions ***
   =========================
   [..]
     (#) HAL_QSPI_GetState() function gives the current state of the HAL QuadSPI driver.
     (#) HAL_QSPI_SetTimeout() function configures the timeout value used in the driver.
     (#) HAL_QSPI_SetFifoThreshold() function configures the threshold on the Fifo of the QSPI IP.
     (#) HAL_QSPI_GetFifoThreshold() function gives the current of the Fifo's threshold 

   *** Workarounds linked to Silicon Limitation ***
   ====================================================
   [..]
     (#) Workarounds Implemented inside HAL Driver
        (++) Extra data written in the FIFO at the end of a read transfer\end{DoxyVerb}
