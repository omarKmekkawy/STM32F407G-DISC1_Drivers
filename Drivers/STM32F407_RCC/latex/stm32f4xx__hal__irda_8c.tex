\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  The IRDA HAL driver can be used as follows:
  
  (#) Declare a IRDA_HandleTypeDef handle structure.
  (#) Initialize the IRDA low level resources by implementing the HAL_IRDA_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the USARTx interface clock.
      (##) IRDA pins configuration:
          (+++) Enable the clock for the IRDA GPIOs.
          (+++) Configure these IRDA pins as alternate function pull-up.
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_IRDA_Transmit_IT()
           and HAL_IRDA_Receive_IT() APIs):
          (+++) Configure the USARTx interrupt priority.
          (+++) Enable the NVIC USART IRQ handle.
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_IRDA_Transmit_DMA()
           and HAL_IRDA_Receive_DMA() APIs):
          (+++) Declare a DMA handle structure for the Tx/Rx stream.
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock.
          (+++) Configure the declared DMA handle structure with the required Tx/Rx parameters.                
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the IRDA DMA Tx/Rx handle.
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.

  (#) Program the Baud Rate, Word Length, Parity, IrDA Mode, Prescaler 
      and Mode(Receiver/Transmitter) in the hirda Init structure.

  (#) Initialize the IRDA registers by calling the HAL_IRDA_Init() API:
      (++) This API configures also the low level Hardware GPIO, CLOCK, CORTEX...etc)
          by calling the customized HAL_IRDA_MspInit() API.
  -@@- The specific IRDA interrupts (Transmission complete interrupt, 
      RXNE interrupt and Error Interrupts) will be managed using the macros
      __HAL_IRDA_ENABLE_IT() and __HAL_IRDA_DISABLE_IT() inside the transmit and receive process.
      
  (#) Three operation modes are available within this driver :
           
  *** Polling mode IO operation ***
  =================================
  [..]    
    (+) Send an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_IRDA_Transmit() 
    (+) Receive an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_IRDA_Receive()
     
  *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***    
  ===================================
  [..]    
    (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_IRDA_Transmit_IT() 
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_IRDA_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_IRDA_TxCpltCallback
    (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_IRDA_Receive_IT() 
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_IRDA_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_IRDA_RxCpltCallback                                      
    (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_IRDA_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_IRDA_ErrorCallback

  *** DMA mode IO operation ***    
  =============================
  [..]
    (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_IRDA_Transmit_DMA() 
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_IRDA_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_IRDA_TxCpltCallback
    (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_IRDA_Receive_DMA() 
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_IRDA_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_IRDA_RxCpltCallback                                      
    (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_IRDA_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_IRDA_ErrorCallback    

  *** IRDA HAL driver macros list ***
  ===================================
  [..]
    Below the list of most used macros in IRDA HAL driver.
     
   (+) __HAL_IRDA_ENABLE: Enable the IRDA peripheral 
   (+) __HAL_IRDA_DISABLE: Disable the IRDA peripheral     
   (+) __HAL_IRDA_GET_FLAG : Checks whether the specified IRDA flag is set or not
   (+) __HAL_IRDA_CLEAR_FLAG : Clears the specified IRDA pending flag
   (+) __HAL_IRDA_ENABLE_IT: Enables the specified IRDA interrupt
   (+) __HAL_IRDA_DISABLE_IT: Disables the specified IRDA interrupt
