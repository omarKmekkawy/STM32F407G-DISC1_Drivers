\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================

[..]
  The SAI HAL driver can be used as follows:

  (#) Declare a SAI_HandleTypeDef handle structure (eg. SAI_HandleTypeDef hsai).
  (#) Initialize the SAI low level resources by implementing the HAL_SAI_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the SAI interface clock.
      (##) SAI pins configuration:
          (+++) Enable the clock for the SAI GPIOs.
          (+++) Configure these SAI pins as alternate function pull-up.
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_SAI_Transmit_IT()
           and HAL_SAI_Receive_IT() APIs):
          (+++) Configure the SAI interrupt priority.
          (+++) Enable the NVIC SAI IRQ handle.

      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_SAI_Transmit_DMA()
           and HAL_SAI_Receive_DMA() APIs):
          (+++) Declare a DMA handle structure for the Tx/Rx stream.
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock.
          (+++) Configure the declared DMA handle structure with the required Tx/Rx parameters.
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the SAI DMA Tx/Rx handle.
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on the
              DMA Tx/Rx Stream.

  (#) The initialization can be done by two ways
      (##) Expert mode : Initialize the structures Init, FrameInit and SlotInit and call HAL_SAI_Init().
      (##) Simplified mode : Initialize the high part of Init Structure and call HAL_SAI_InitProtocol().

[..]
  (@) The specific SAI interrupts (FIFO request and Overrun underrun interrupt)
      will be managed using the macros __HAL_SAI_ENABLE_IT() and __HAL_SAI_DISABLE_IT()
      inside the transmit and receive process.

[..]
 (@) SAI Clock Source configuration is managed differently depending on the selected
     STM32F4 devices :
     (+@) For STM32F446xx devices, the configuration is managed through RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig()
          function in the HAL RCC drivers
     (+@) For STM32F439xx/STM32F437xx/STM32F429xx/STM32F427xx devices, the configuration 
          is managed within HAL SAI drivers through HAL_SAI_Init() function using
          ClockSource field of SAI_InitTypeDef structure.
[..]
 (@) Make sure that either:
     (+@) I2S PLL is configured or
     (+@) SAI PLL is configured or
     (+@) External clock source is configured after setting correctly
          the define constant EXTERNAL_CLOCK_VALUE in the stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h file.
[..]
  (@) In master Tx mode: enabling the audio block immediately generates the bit clock
      for the external slaves even if there is no data in the FIFO, However FS signal
      generation is conditioned by the presence of data in the FIFO.

[..]
  (@) In master Rx mode: enabling the audio block immediately generates the bit clock
      and FS signal for the external slaves.

[..]
  (@) It is mandatory to respect the following conditions in order to avoid bad SAI behavior:
      (+@) First bit Offset <= (SLOT size - Data size)
      (+@) Data size <= SLOT size
      (+@) Number of SLOT x SLOT size = Frame length
      (+@) The number of slots should be even when SAI_FS_CHANNEL_IDENTIFICATION is selected.

[..]
  Three operation modes are available within this driver :

  *** Polling mode IO operation ***
  =================================
  [..]
    (+) Send an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_SAI_Transmit()
    (+) Receive an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_SAI_Receive()

  *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***
  ===================================
  [..]
    (+) Send an amount of data in non-blocking mode using HAL_SAI_Transmit_IT()
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_SAI_TxCpltCallback() is executed and user can
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SAI_TxCpltCallback()
    (+) Receive an amount of data in non-blocking mode using HAL_SAI_Receive_IT()
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_SAI_RxCpltCallback() is executed and user can
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SAI_RxCpltCallback()
    (+) In case of flag error, HAL_SAI_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SAI_ErrorCallback()

  *** DMA mode IO operation ***
  =============================
  [..]
    (+) Send an amount of data in non-blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_SAI_Transmit_DMA()
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_SAI_TxCpltCallback() is executed and user can
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SAI_TxCpltCallback()
    (+) Receive an amount of data in non-blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_SAI_Receive_DMA()
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_SAI_RxCpltCallback() is executed and user can
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SAI_RxCpltCallback()
    (+) In case of flag error, HAL_SAI_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SAI_ErrorCallback()
    (+) Pause the DMA Transfer using HAL_SAI_DMAPause()
    (+) Resume the DMA Transfer using HAL_SAI_DMAResume()
    (+) Stop the DMA Transfer using HAL_SAI_DMAStop()
