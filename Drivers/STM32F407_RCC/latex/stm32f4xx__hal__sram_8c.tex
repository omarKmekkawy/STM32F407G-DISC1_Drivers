                        ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================  
[..]
  This driver is a generic layered driver which contains a set of APIs used to 
  control SRAM memories. It uses the FMC layer functions to interface 
  with SRAM devices.  
  The following sequence should be followed to configure the FMC/FSMC to interface
  with SRAM/PSRAM memories: 
    
 (#) Declare a SRAM_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
        SRAM_HandleTypeDef  hsram; and: 
        
     (++) Fill the SRAM_HandleTypeDef handle "Init" field with the allowed 
          values of the structure member.
          
     (++) Fill the SRAM_HandleTypeDef handle "Instance" field with a predefined 
          base register instance for NOR or SRAM device 
                       
     (++) Fill the SRAM_HandleTypeDef handle "Extended" field with a predefined
          base register instance for NOR or SRAM extended mode 
           
 (#) Declare two FMC_NORSRAM_TimingTypeDef structures, for both normal and extended 
     mode timings; for example:
        FMC_NORSRAM_TimingTypeDef  Timing and FMC_NORSRAM_TimingTypeDef  ExTiming;
    and fill its fields with the allowed values of the structure member.
    
 (#) Initialize the SRAM Controller by calling the function HAL_SRAM_Init(). This function
     performs the following sequence:
        
     (##) MSP hardware layer configuration using the function HAL_SRAM_MspInit()
     (##) Control register configuration using the FMC NORSRAM interface function 
          FMC_NORSRAM_Init()
     (##) Timing register configuration using the FMC NORSRAM interface function 
          FMC_NORSRAM_Timing_Init()
     (##) Extended mode Timing register configuration using the FMC NORSRAM interface function 
          FMC_NORSRAM_Extended_Timing_Init()
     (##) Enable the SRAM device using the macro __FMC_NORSRAM_ENABLE()    

 (#) At this stage you can perform read/write accesses from/to the memory connected 
     to the NOR/SRAM Bank. You can perform either polling or DMA transfer using the
     following APIs:
     (++) HAL_SRAM_Read()/HAL_SRAM_Write() for polling read/write access
     (++) HAL_SRAM_Read_DMA()/HAL_SRAM_Write_DMA() for DMA read/write transfer
     
 (#) You can also control the SRAM device by calling the control APIs HAL_SRAM_WriteOperation_Enable()/
     HAL_SRAM_WriteOperation_Disable() to respectively enable/disable the SRAM write operation  
     
 (#) You can continuously monitor the SRAM device HAL state by calling the function
     HAL_SRAM_GetState()              \end{DoxyVerb}
