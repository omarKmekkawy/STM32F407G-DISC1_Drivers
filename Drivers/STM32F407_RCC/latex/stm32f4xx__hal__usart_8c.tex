                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  The USART HAL driver can be used as follows:

  (#) Declare a USART_HandleTypeDef handle structure.
  (#) Initialize the USART low level resources by implementing the HAL_USART_MspInit () API:
      (##) Enable the USARTx interface clock.
      (##) USART pins configuration:
           (+++) Enable the clock for the USART GPIOs.
           (+++) Configure these USART pins as alternate function pull-up.
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_USART_Transmit_IT(),
           HAL_USART_Receive_IT() and HAL_USART_TransmitReceive_IT() APIs):
           (+++) Configure the USARTx interrupt priority.
           (+++) Enable the NVIC USART IRQ handle.
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_USART_Transmit_DMA()
           HAL_USART_Receive_IT() and HAL_USART_TransmitReceive_IT() APIs):
           (+++) Declare a DMA handle structure for the Tx/Rx stream.
           (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock.
           (+++) Configure the declared DMA handle structure with the required Tx/Rx parameters.
           (+++) Configure the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.
           (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the USART DMA Tx/Rx handle.
           (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.

  (#) Program the Baud Rate, Word Length, Stop Bit, Parity, Hardware
      flow control and Mode(Receiver/Transmitter) in the husart Init structure.

  (#) Initialize the USART registers by calling the HAL_USART_Init() API:
      (++) These APIs configures also the low level Hardware GPIO, CLOCK, CORTEX...etc)
           by calling the customized HAL_USART_MspInit(&husart) API.

      -@@- The specific USART interrupts (Transmission complete interrupt,
           RXNE interrupt and Error Interrupts) will be managed using the macros
           __HAL_USART_ENABLE_IT() and __HAL_USART_DISABLE_IT() inside the transmit and receive process.

  (#) Three operation modes are available within this driver :

   *** Polling mode IO operation ***
   =================================
   [..]
     (+) Send an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_USART_Transmit()
     (+) Receive an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_USART_Receive()

   *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***
   ===================================
   [..]
     (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_USART_Transmit_IT()
     (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_USART_TxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_USART_TxCpltCallback
     (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_USART_Receive_IT()
     (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_USART_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_USART_RxCpltCallback
     (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_USART_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_USART_ErrorCallback

   *** DMA mode IO operation ***
   ==============================
   [..]
     (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_USART_Transmit_DMA()
     (+) At transmission end of half transfer HAL_USART_TxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_USART_TxHalfCpltCallback
     (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_USART_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_USART_TxCpltCallback
     (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_USART_Receive_DMA()
     (+) At reception end of half transfer HAL_USART_RxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_USART_RxHalfCpltCallback
     (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_USART_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_USART_RxCpltCallback
     (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_USART_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_USART_ErrorCallback
     (+) Pause the DMA Transfer using HAL_USART_DMAPause()
     (+) Resume the DMA Transfer using HAL_USART_DMAResume()
     (+) Stop the DMA Transfer using HAL_USART_DMAStop()

   *** USART HAL driver macros list ***
   =============================================
   [..]
     Below the list of most used macros in USART HAL driver.

     (+) __HAL_USART_ENABLE: Enable the USART peripheral
     (+) __HAL_USART_DISABLE: Disable the USART peripheral
     (+) __HAL_USART_GET_FLAG : Check whether the specified USART flag is set or not
     (+) __HAL_USART_CLEAR_FLAG : Clear the specified USART pending flag
     (+) __HAL_USART_ENABLE_IT: Enable the specified USART interrupt
     (+) __HAL_USART_DISABLE_IT: Disable the specified USART interrupt
