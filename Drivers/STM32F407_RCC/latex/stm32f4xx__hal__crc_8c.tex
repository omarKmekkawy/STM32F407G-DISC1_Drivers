                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
    The CRC HAL driver can be used as follows:

    (#) Enable CRC AHB clock using __HAL_RCC_CRC_CLK_ENABLE();

    (#) Use HAL_CRC_Accumulate() function to compute the CRC value of 
        a 32-bit data buffer using combination of the previous CRC value
        and the new one.

    (#) Use HAL_CRC_Calculate() function to compute the CRC Value of 
        a new 32-bit data buffer. This function resets the CRC computation  
        unit before starting the computation to avoid getting wrong CRC values.\end{DoxyVerb}
