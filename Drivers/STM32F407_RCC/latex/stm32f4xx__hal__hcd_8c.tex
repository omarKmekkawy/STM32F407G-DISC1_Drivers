                  ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  (#)Declare a HCD_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
     HCD_HandleTypeDef  hhcd;
      
  (#)Fill parameters of Init structure in HCD handle

  (#)Call HAL_HCD_Init() API to initialize the HCD peripheral (Core, Host core, ...) 

  (#)Initialize the HCD low level resources through the HAL_HCD_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the HCD/USB Low Level interface clock using the following macros
           (+++) __HAL_RCC_USB_OTG_FS_CLK_ENABLE();
           (+++) __HAL_RCC_USB_OTG_HS_CLK_ENABLE(); (For High Speed Mode)
           (+++) __HAL_RCC_USB_OTG_HS_ULPI_CLK_ENABLE(); (For High Speed Mode)
         
      (##) Initialize the related GPIO clocks
      (##) Configure HCD pin-out
      (##) Configure HCD NVIC interrupt
  
  (#)Associate the Upper USB Host stack to the HAL HCD Driver:
      (##) hhcd.pData = phost;

  (#)Enable HCD transmission and reception:
      (##) HAL_HCD_Start();\end{DoxyVerb}
