\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  The UART HAL driver can be used as follows:
  
  (#) Declare a UART_HandleTypeDef handle structure.

  (#) Initialize the UART low level resources by implementing the HAL_UART_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the USARTx interface clock.
      (##) UART pins configuration:
          (+++) Enable the clock for the UART GPIOs.
          (+++) Configure these UART pins as alternate function pull-up.
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_UART_Transmit_IT()
           and HAL_UART_Receive_IT() APIs):
          (+++) Configure the USARTx interrupt priority.
          (+++) Enable the NVIC USART IRQ handle.
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_UART_Transmit_DMA()
           and HAL_UART_Receive_DMA() APIs):
          (+++) Declare a DMA handle structure for the Tx/Rx stream.
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock.
          (+++) Configure the declared DMA handle structure with the required 
                Tx/Rx parameters.                
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the UART DMA Tx/Rx handle.
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete 
                interrupt on the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.

  (#) Program the Baud Rate, Word Length, Stop Bit, Parity, Hardware 
      flow control and Mode(Receiver/Transmitter) in the Init structure.

  (#) For the UART asynchronous mode, initialize the UART registers by calling
      the HAL_UART_Init() API.
  
  (#) For the UART Half duplex mode, initialize the UART registers by calling 
      the HAL_HalfDuplex_Init() API.
  
  (#) For the LIN mode, initialize the UART registers by calling the HAL_LIN_Init() API.
  
  (#) For the Multi-Processor mode, initialize the UART registers by calling 
      the HAL_MultiProcessor_Init() API.
      
   [..] 
     (@) The specific UART interrupts (Transmission complete interrupt, 
          RXNE interrupt and Error Interrupts) will be managed using the macros
          __HAL_UART_ENABLE_IT() and __HAL_UART_DISABLE_IT() inside the transmit 
          and receive process.
        
   [..] 
     (@) These APIs (HAL_UART_Init() and HAL_HalfDuplex_Init()) configure also the 
          low level Hardware GPIO, CLOCK, CORTEX...etc) by calling the customized 
          HAL_UART_MspInit() API.
        
   [..] 
      Three operation modes are available within this driver :     

   *** Polling mode IO operation ***
   =================================
   [..]    
     (+) Send an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_UART_Transmit() 
     (+) Receive an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_UART_Receive()
     
   *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***    
   ===================================
   [..]    
     (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_UART_Transmit_IT() 
     (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback
     (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_UART_Receive_IT() 
     (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback
     (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_UART_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_UART_ErrorCallback

   *** DMA mode IO operation ***    
   ==============================
   [..] 
     (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_UART_Transmit_DMA() 
     (+) At transmission end of half transfer HAL_UART_TxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_UART_TxHalfCpltCallback 
     (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback
     (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_UART_Receive_DMA() 
     (+) At reception end of half transfer HAL_UART_RxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_UART_RxHalfCpltCallback 
     (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback

          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_UART_ErrorCallback
     (+) Pause the DMA Transfer using HAL_UART_DMAPause()      
     (+) Resume the DMA Transfer using HAL_UART_DMAResume()  
     (+) Stop the DMA Transfer using HAL_UART_DMAStop()      
  
   *** UART HAL driver macros list ***
