                     ##### How to use this driver #####
============================================================================== 
[..]
  This driver is a generic layered driver which contains a set of APIs used to 
  control SDRAM memories. It uses the FMC layer functions to interface 
  with SDRAM devices.  
  The following sequence should be followed to configure the FMC to interface
  with SDRAM memories: 
    
 (#) Declare a SDRAM_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
        SDRAM_HandleTypeDef  hdsram 
        
     (++) Fill the SDRAM_HandleTypeDef handle "Init" field with the allowed 
          values of the structure member.
          
     (++) Fill the SDRAM_HandleTypeDef handle "Instance" field with a predefined 
          base register instance for NOR or SDRAM device 
           
 (#) Declare a FMC_SDRAM_TimingTypeDef structure; for example:
        FMC_SDRAM_TimingTypeDef  Timing;
    and fill its fields with the allowed values of the structure member.
    
 (#) Initialize the SDRAM Controller by calling the function HAL_SDRAM_Init(). This function
     performs the following sequence:
        
     (##) MSP hardware layer configuration using the function HAL_SDRAM_MspInit()
     (##) Control register configuration using the FMC SDRAM interface function 
          FMC_SDRAM_Init()
     (##) Timing register configuration using the FMC SDRAM interface function 
          FMC_SDRAM_Timing_Init()
     (##) Program the SDRAM external device by applying its initialization sequence
          according to the device plugged in your hardware. This step is mandatory
          for accessing the SDRAM device.   

 (#) At this stage you can perform read/write accesses from/to the memory connected 
     to the SDRAM Bank. You can perform either polling or DMA transfer using the
     following APIs:
     (++) HAL_SDRAM_Read()/HAL_SDRAM_Write() for polling read/write access
     (++) HAL_SDRAM_Read_DMA()/HAL_SDRAM_Write_DMA() for DMA read/write transfer
     
 (#) You can also control the SDRAM device by calling the control APIs HAL_SDRAM_WriteOperation_Enable()/
     HAL_SDRAM_WriteOperation_Disable() to respectively enable/disable the SDRAM write operation or 
     the function HAL_SDRAM_SendCommand() to send a specified command to the SDRAM
     device. The command to be sent must be configured with the FMC_SDRAM_CommandTypeDef 
     structure.   
     
 (#) You can continuously monitor the SDRAM device HAL state by calling the function
     HAL_SDRAM_GetState()         \end{DoxyVerb}
