                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
    The CRYP HAL driver can be used as follows:

    (#)Initialize the CRYP low level resources by implementing the HAL_CRYP_MspInit():
       (##) Enable the CRYP interface clock using __HAL_RCC_CRYP_CLK_ENABLE()
       (##) In case of using interrupts (e.g. HAL_CRYP_AESECB_Encrypt_IT())
           (+++) Configure the CRYP interrupt priority using HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
           (+++) Enable the CRYP IRQ handler using HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
           (+++) In CRYP IRQ handler, call HAL_CRYP_IRQHandler()
       (##) In case of using DMA to control data transfer (e.g. HAL_CRYP_AESECB_Encrypt_DMA())
           (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using __DMAx_CLK_ENABLE()
           (+++) Configure and enable two DMA streams one for managing data transfer from
               memory to peripheral (input stream) and another stream for managing data
               transfer from peripheral to memory (output stream)
           (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the CRYP DMA handle
               using  __HAL_LINKDMA()
           (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete
               interrupt on the two DMA Streams. The output stream should have higher
               priority than the input stream HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() and HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
  
    (#)Initialize the CRYP HAL using HAL_CRYP_Init(). This function configures mainly:
       (##) The data type: 1-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit
       (##) The key size: 128, 192 and 256. This parameter is relevant only for AES
       (##) The encryption/decryption key. It's size depends on the algorithm
            used for encryption/decryption
       (##) The initialization vector (counter). It is not used ECB mode.
  
    (#)Three processing (encryption/decryption) functions are available:
       (##) Polling mode: encryption and decryption APIs are blocking functions
            i.e. they process the data and wait till the processing is finished,
            e.g. HAL_CRYP_AESCBC_Encrypt()
       (##) Interrupt mode: encryption and decryption APIs are not blocking functions
            i.e. they process the data under interrupt,
            e.g. HAL_CRYP_AESCBC_Encrypt_IT()
       (##) DMA mode: encryption and decryption APIs are not blocking functions
            i.e. the data transfer is ensured by DMA,
            e.g. HAL_CRYP_AESCBC_Encrypt_DMA()
  
    (#)When the processing function is called at first time after HAL_CRYP_Init()
       the CRYP peripheral is initialized and processes the buffer in input.
       At second call, the processing function performs an append of the already
       processed buffer.
       When a new data block is to be processed, call HAL_CRYP_Init() then the
       processing function.
  
     (#)Call HAL_CRYP_DeInit() to deinitialize the CRYP peripheral.\end{DoxyVerb}
