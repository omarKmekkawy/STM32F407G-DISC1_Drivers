                   ##### I2S Extension features #####
 ==============================================================================
 [..]
    (#) In I2S full duplex mode, each SPI peripheral is able to manage sending and receiving 
        data simultaneously using two data lines. Each SPI peripheral has an extended block 
        called I2Sxext (i.e I2S2ext for SPI2 and I2S3ext for SPI3).
    (#) The extension block is not a full SPI IP, it is used only as I2S slave to
        implement full duplex mode. The extension block uses the same clock sources
        as its master.

    (#) Both I2Sx and I2Sx_ext can be configured as transmitters or receivers.

    [..]
      (@) Only I2Sx can deliver SCK and WS to I2Sx_ext in full duplex mode, where 
        I2Sx can be I2S2 or I2S3.

                 ##### How to use this driver #####
===============================================================================
[..]    
  Three operation modes are available within this driver :     
 
  *** Polling mode IO operation ***
  =================================
  [..]    
    (+) Send and receive in the same time an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_I2S_TransmitReceive() 
  
  *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***    
  ===================================
  [..]    
    (+) Send and receive in the same time an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_I2S_TransmitReceive_IT() 
    (+) At transmission end of half transfer HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback 
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback
    (+) At reception end of half transfer HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback 
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback                                      
    (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_I2S_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_ErrorCallback

  *** DMA mode IO operation ***    
  ==============================
  [..] 
    (+) Send and receive an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_I2S_TransmitReceive_DMA() 
    (+) At transmission end of half transfer HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback 
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback
    (+) At reception end of half transfer HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback 
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback                                     
    (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_I2S_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2S_ErrorCallback
    (+) Pause the DMA Transfer using HAL_I2S_DMAPause()      
    (+) Resume the DMA Transfer using HAL_I2S_DMAResume()  
    (+) Stop the DMA Transfer using HAL_I2S_DMAStop()  \end{DoxyVerb}
