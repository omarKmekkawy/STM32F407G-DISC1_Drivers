                      ##### FLASH peripheral features #####
==============================================================================
         
[..] The Flash memory interface manages CPU AHB I-Code and D-Code accesses 
     to the Flash memory. It implements the erase and program Flash memory operations 
     and the read and write protection mechanisms.
    
[..] The Flash memory interface accelerates code execution with a system of instruction
     prefetch and cache lines. 

[..] The FLASH main features are:
    (+) Flash memory read operations
    (+) Flash memory program/erase operations
    (+) Read / write protections
    (+) Prefetch on I-Code
    (+) 64 cache lines of 128 bits on I-Code
    (+) 8 cache lines of 128 bits on D-Code
    
    
                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]                             
    This driver provides functions and macros to configure and program the FLASH 
    memory of all STM32F4xx devices.
  
    (#) FLASH Memory IO Programming functions: 
         (++) Lock and Unlock the FLASH interface using HAL_FLASH_Unlock() and 
              HAL_FLASH_Lock() functions
         (++) Program functions: byte, half word, word and double word
         (++) There Two modes of programming :
          (+++) Polling mode using HAL_FLASH_Program() function
          (+++) Interrupt mode using HAL_FLASH_Program_IT() function
  
    (#) Interrupts and flags management functions : 
         (++) Handle FLASH interrupts by calling HAL_FLASH_IRQHandler()
         (++) Wait for last FLASH operation according to its status
         (++) Get error flag status by calling HAL_SetErrorCode()          

  [..] 
    In addition to these functions, this driver includes a set of macros allowing
    to handle the following operations:
     (+) Set the latency
     (+) Enable/Disable the prefetch buffer
     (+) Enable/Disable the Instruction cache and the Data cache
     (+) Reset the Instruction cache and the Data cache
     (+) Enable/Disable the FLASH interrupts
     (+) Monitor the FLASH flags status\end{DoxyVerb}
