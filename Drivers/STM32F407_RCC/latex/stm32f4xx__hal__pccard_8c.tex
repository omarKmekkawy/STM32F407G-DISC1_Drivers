                       ##### How to use this driver #####
===============================================================================  
  [..]
    This driver is a generic layered driver which contains a set of APIs used to 
    control PCCARD/compact flash memories. It uses the FMC/FSMC layer functions 
    to interface with PCCARD devices. This driver is used for:
   
   (+) PCCARD/Compact Flash memory configuration sequence using the function 
       HAL_PCCARD_Init()/HAL_CF_Init() with control and timing parameters for
       both common and attribute spaces.
           
   (+) Read PCCARD/Compact Flash memory maker and device IDs using the function
       HAL_PCCARD_Read_ID()/HAL_CF_Read_ID(). The read information is stored in
       the CompactFlash_ID structure declared by the function caller. 
       
   (+) Access PCCARD/Compact Flash memory by read/write operations using the functions
       HAL_PCCARD_Read_Sector()/ HAL_PCCARD_Write_Sector() - 
       HAL_CF_Read_Sector()/HAL_CF_Write_Sector(), to read/write sector. 
       
   (+) Perform PCCARD/Compact Flash Reset chip operation using the function
       HAL_PCCARD_Reset()/HAL_CF_Reset.
       
   (+) Perform PCCARD/Compact Flash erase sector operation using the function 
       HAL_PCCARD_Erase_Sector()/HAL_CF_Erase_Sector.
   
   (+) Read the PCCARD/Compact Flash status operation using the function
       HAL_PCCARD_ReadStatus()/HAL_CF_ReadStatus().
    
   (+) You can monitor the PCCARD/Compact Flash  device HAL state by calling
       the function HAL_PCCARD_GetState()/HAL_CF_GetState()
       
  [..]
    (@) This driver is a set of generic APIs which handle standard PCCARD/compact flash 
        operations. If a PCCARD/Compact Flash device contains different operations 
        and/or implementations, it should be implemented separately.\end{DoxyVerb}
