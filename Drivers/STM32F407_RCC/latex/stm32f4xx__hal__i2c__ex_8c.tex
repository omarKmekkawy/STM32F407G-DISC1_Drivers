             ##### I2C peripheral extension features  #####
==============================================================================
         
[..] Comparing to other previous devices, the I2C interface for STM32F427xx/437xx/ 
     429xx/439xx devices contains the following additional features :
     
     (+) Possibility to disable or enable Analog Noise Filter
     (+) Use of a configured Digital Noise Filter
 
                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..] This driver provides functions to configure Noise Filter
  (#) Configure I2C Analog noise filter using the function HAL_I2C_AnalogFilter_Config()
  (#) Configure I2C Digital noise filter using the function HAL_I2C_DigitalFilter_Config()\end{DoxyVerb}
