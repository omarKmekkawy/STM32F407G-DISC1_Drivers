                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  This driver implements a high level communication layer for read and write from/to 
  this memory. The needed STM32 hardware resources (SDIO and GPIO) are performed by 
  the user in HAL_SD_MspInit() function (MSP layer).                             
  Basically, the MSP layer configuration should be the same as we provide in the 
  examples.
  You can easily tailor this configuration according to hardware resources.

[..]
  This driver is a generic layered driver for SDIO memories which uses the HAL 
  SDIO driver functions to interface with SD and uSD cards devices. 
  It is used as follows:

  (#)Initialize the SDIO low level resources by implement the HAL_SD_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the SDIO interface clock using __HAL_RCC_SDIO_CLK_ENABLE(); 
      (##) SDIO pins configuration for SD card
          (+++) Enable the clock for the SDIO GPIOs using the functions __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE();   
          (+++) Configure these SDIO pins as alternate function pull-up using HAL_GPIO_Init()
                and according to your pin assignment;
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_SD_ReadBlocks_DMA()
           and HAL_SD_WriteBlocks_DMA() APIs).
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using __HAL_RCC_DMAx_CLK_ENABLE(); 
          (+++) Configure the DMA using the function HAL_DMA_Init() with predeclared and filled. 
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process when using DMA transfer.
          (+++) Configure the SDIO and DMA interrupt priorities using functions
                HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(); DMA priority is superior to SDIO's priority
          (+++) Enable the NVIC DMA and SDIO IRQs using function HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
          (+++) SDIO interrupts are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_SDIO_ENABLE_IT() 
                and __HAL_SD_SDIO_DISABLE_IT() inside the communication process.
          (+++) SDIO interrupts pending bits are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_SDIO_GET_IT()
                and __HAL_SD_SDIO_CLEAR_IT()
  (#) At this stage, you can perform SD read/write/erase operations after SD card initialization  

       
*** SD Card Initialization and configuration ***
================================================    
[..]
  To initialize the SD Card, use the HAL_SD_Init() function.  It Initializes 
  the SD Card and put it into Standby State (Ready for data transfer). 
  This function provide the following operations:

  (#) Apply the SD Card initialization process at 400KHz and check the SD Card 
      type (Standard Capacity or High Capacity). You can change or adapt this 
      frequency by adjusting the "ClockDiv" field. 
      The SD Card frequency (SDIO_CK) is computed as follows:

         SDIO_CK = SDIOCLK / (ClockDiv + 2)

      In initialization mode and according to the SD Card standard, 
      make sure that the SDIO_CK frequency doesn't exceed 400KHz.

  (#) Get the SD CID and CSD data. All these information are managed by the SDCardInfo 
      structure. This structure provide also ready computed SD Card capacity 
      and Block size.
      
      -@- These information are stored in SD handle structure in case of future use.  

  (#) Configure the SD Card Data transfer frequency. By Default, the card transfer 
      frequency is set to 24MHz. You can change or adapt this frequency by adjusting 
      the "ClockDiv" field.
      In transfer mode and according to the SD Card standard, make sure that the 
      SDIO_CK frequency doesn't exceed 25MHz and 50MHz in High-speed mode switch.
      To be able to use a frequency higher than 24MHz, you should use the SDIO 
      peripheral in bypass mode. Refer to the corresponding reference manual 
      for more details.

  (#) Select the corresponding SD Card according to the address read with the step 2.
  
  (#) Configure the SD Card in wide bus mode: 4-bits data.

*** SD Card Read operation ***
==============================
[..] 
  (+) You can read from SD card in polling mode by using function HAL_SD_ReadBlocks(). 
      This function support only 512-bytes block length (the block size should be 
      chosen as 512 bytes).
      You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation 
      by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.

  (+) You can read from SD card in DMA mode by using function HAL_SD_ReadBlocks_DMA().
      This function support only 512-bytes block length (the block size should be 
      chosen as 512 bytes).
      You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation 
      by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
      After this, you have to call the function HAL_SD_CheckReadOperation(), to insure
      that the read transfer is done correctly in both DMA and SD sides.

*** SD Card Write operation ***
=============================== 
[..] 
  (+) You can write to SD card in polling mode by using function HAL_SD_WriteBlocks(). 
      This function support only 512-bytes block length (the block size should be 
      chosen as 512 bytes).
      You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation 
      by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.

  (+) You can write to SD card in DMA mode by using function HAL_SD_WriteBlocks_DMA().
      This function support only 512-bytes block length (the block size should be 
      chosen as 512 byte).
      You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation 
      by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
      After this, you have to call the function HAL_SD_CheckWriteOperation(), to insure
      that the write transfer is done correctly in both DMA and SD sides.  

*** SD card status ***
====================== 
[..]
  (+) At any time, you can check the SD Card status and get the SD card state 
      by using the HAL_SD_GetStatus() function. This function checks first if the 
      SD card is still connected and then get the internal SD Card transfer state.     
  (+) You can also get the SD card SD Status register by using the HAL_SD_SendSDStatus() 
      function.    

*** SD HAL driver macros list ***
==================================
[..]
  Below the list of most used macros in SD HAL driver.

  (+) __HAL_SD_SDIO_ENABLE : Enable the SD device
  (+) __HAL_SD_SDIO_DISABLE : Disable the SD device
  (+) __HAL_SD_SDIO_DMA_ENABLE: Enable the SDIO DMA transfer
  (+) __HAL_SD_SDIO_DMA_DISABLE: Disable the SDIO DMA transfer
  (+) __HAL_SD_SDIO_ENABLE_IT: Enable the SD device interrupt
  (+) __HAL_SD_SDIO_DISABLE_IT: Disable the SD device interrupt
  (+) __HAL_SD_SDIO_GET_FLAG:Check whether the specified SD flag is set or not
  (+) __HAL_SD_SDIO_CLEAR_FLAG: Clear the SD's pending flags
