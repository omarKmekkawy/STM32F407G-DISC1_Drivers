                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
    (#) Program the required configuration through the following parameters:
        the transfer mode, the output color mode and the output offset using
        HAL_DMA2D_Init() function.

    (#) Program the required configuration through the following parameters:
        the input color mode, the input color, the input alpha value, the alpha mode,
        and the input offset using HAL_DMA2D_ConfigLayer() function for foreground 
        or/and background layer.
        
   *** Polling mode IO operation ***
   =================================
  [..]
     (#) Configure pdata parameter (explained hereafter), destination and data length
         and enable the transfer using HAL_DMA2D_Start().
     (#) Wait for end of transfer using HAL_DMA2D_PollForTransfer(), at this stage
         user can specify the value of timeout according to his end application.

   *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***
   ===================================
   [..]
     (#) Configure pdata parameter, destination and data length and enable 
         the transfer using HAL_DMA2D_Start_IT().
     (#) Use HAL_DMA2D_IRQHandler() called under DMA2D_IRQHandler() interrupt subroutine
     (#) At the end of data transfer HAL_DMA2D_IRQHandler() function is executed and user can
         add his own function by customization of function pointer XferCpltCallback (member
         of DMA2D handle structure).
     (#) In case of error, the HAL_DMA2D_IRQHandler() function will call the callback
         XferErrorCallback.

       -@-   In Register-to-Memory transfer mode, pdata parameter is the register
             color, in Memory-to-memory or Memory-to-Memory with pixel format
             conversion pdata is the source address.

       -@-   Configure the foreground source address, the background source address,
             the destination and data length then Enable the transfer using
             HAL_DMA2D_BlendingStart() in polling mode and HAL_DMA2D_BlendingStart_IT()
             in interrupt mode

       -@-   HAL_DMA2D_BlendingStart() and HAL_DMA2D_BlendingStart_IT() functions
             are used if the memory to memory with blending transfer mode is selected.

    (#) Optionally, configure and enable the CLUT using HAL_DMA2D_CLUTLoad() in polling
        mode or HAL_DMA2D_CLUTLoad_IT() in interrupt mode.

    (#) Optionally, configure the line watermark in using the API HAL_DMA2D_ProgramLineEvent()

    (#) Optionally, configure the dead time value in the AHB clock cycle inserted between two 
        consecutive accesses on the AHB master port in using the API HAL_DMA2D_ConfigDeadTime()
        and enable/disable the functionality  with the APIs HAL_DMA2D_EnableDeadTime() or
        HAL_DMA2D_DisableDeadTime().

    (#) The transfer can be suspended, resumed and aborted using the following
        functions: HAL_DMA2D_Suspend(), HAL_DMA2D_Resume(), HAL_DMA2D_Abort().

    (#) The CLUT loading can be suspended, resumed and aborted using the following
        functions: HAL_DMA2D_CLUTLoading_Suspend(), HAL_DMA2D_CLUTLoading_Resume(),
        HAL_DMA2D_CLUTLoading_Abort().

    (#) To control the DMA2D state, use the following function: HAL_DMA2D_GetState().
    
    (#) To read the DMA2D error code, use the following function: HAL_DMA2D_GetError().

   *** DMA2D HAL driver macros list ***
   =============================================
   [..]
     Below the list of most used macros in DMA2D HAL driver :

    (+) __HAL_DMA2D_ENABLE: Enable the DMA2D peripheral.
    (+) __HAL_DMA2D_GET_FLAG: Get the DMA2D pending flags.
    (+) __HAL_DMA2D_CLEAR_FLAG: Clear the DMA2D pending flags.
    (+) __HAL_DMA2D_ENABLE_IT: Enable the specified DMA2D interrupts.
    (+) __HAL_DMA2D_DISABLE_IT: Disable the specified DMA2D interrupts.
    (+) __HAL_DMA2D_GET_IT_SOURCE: Check whether the specified DMA2D interrupt is enabled or not

   [..]
