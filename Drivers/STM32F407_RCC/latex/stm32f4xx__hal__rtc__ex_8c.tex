\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..] 
  (+) Enable the RTC domain access.
  (+) Configure the RTC Prescaler (Asynchronous and Synchronous) and RTC hour 
      format using the HAL_RTC_Init() function.

*** RTC Wake-up configuration ***
================================
[..] 
  (+) To configure the RTC Wake-up Clock source and Counter use the HAL_RTC_SetWakeUpTimer()
      function. You can also configure the RTC Wake-up timer in interrupt mode 
      using the HAL_RTC_SetWakeUpTimer_IT() function.
  (+) To read the RTC Wake-up Counter register, use the HAL_RTC_GetWakeUpTimer() 
      function.

*** TimeStamp configuration ***
===============================
[..]
  (+) Configure the RTC_AFx trigger and enable the RTC TimeStamp using the 
      HAL_RTC_SetTimeStamp() function. You can also configure the RTC TimeStamp with 
      interrupt mode using the HAL_RTC_SetTimeStamp_IT() function.
  (+) To read the RTC TimeStamp Time and Date register, use the HAL_RTC_GetTimeStamp()
      function.
  (+) The TIMESTAMP alternate function can be mapped either to RTC_AF1 (PC13)
      or RTC_AF2 (PI8 or PA0 only for STM32F446xx devices) depending on the value of TSINSEL bit in 
      RTC_TAFCR register. The corresponding pin is also selected by HAL_RTC_SetTimeStamp()
      or HAL_RTC_SetTimeStamp_IT() function.

*** Tamper configuration ***
============================
[..]
  (+) Enable the RTC Tamper and configure the Tamper filter count, trigger Edge 
      or Level according to the Tamper filter (if equal to 0 Edge else Level) 
      value, sampling frequency, precharge or discharge and Pull-UP using the 
      HAL_RTC_SetTamper() function. You can configure RTC Tamper in interrupt 
      mode using HAL_RTC_SetTamper_IT() function.
  (+) The TAMPER1 alternate function can be mapped either to RTC_AF1 (PC13)
      or RTC_AF2 (PI8 or PA0 only for STM32F446xx devices) depending on the value of TAMP1INSEL bit in 
      RTC_TAFCR register. The corresponding pin is also selected by HAL_RTC_SetTamper()
      or HAL_RTC_SetTamper_IT() function.

*** Backup Data Registers configuration ***
===========================================
[..]
  (+) To write to the RTC Backup Data registers, use the HAL_RTC_BKUPWrite()
      function.  
  (+) To read the RTC Backup Data registers, use the HAL_RTC_BKUPRead()
      function.\end{DoxyVerb}
