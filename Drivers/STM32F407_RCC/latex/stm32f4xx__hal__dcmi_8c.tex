                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
    The sequence below describes how to use this driver to capture image
    from a camera module connected to the DCMI Interface.
    This sequence does not take into account the configuration of the
    camera module, which should be made before to configure and enable
    the DCMI to capture images.

  (#) Program the required configuration through following parameters:
      horizontal and vertical polarity, pixel clock polarity, Capture Rate,
      Synchronization Mode, code of the frame delimiter and data width 
      using HAL_DCMI_Init() function.

  (#) Configure the DMA2_Stream1 channel1 to transfer Data from DCMI DR
      register to the destination memory buffer.

  (#) Program the required configuration through following parameters:
      DCMI mode, destination memory Buffer address and the data length
      and enable capture using HAL_DCMI_Start_DMA() function.

  (#) Optionally, configure and Enable the CROP feature to select a rectangular
      window from the received image using HAL_DCMI_ConfigCrop()
      and HAL_DCMI_EnableCROP() functions

  (#) The capture can be stopped using HAL_DCMI_Stop() function.

  (#) To control DCMI state you can use the function HAL_DCMI_GetState().

   *** DCMI HAL driver macros list ***
   =============================================
   [..]
     Below the list of most used macros in DCMI HAL driver.
     
    (+) __HAL_DCMI_ENABLE: Enable the DCMI peripheral.
    (+) __HAL_DCMI_DISABLE: Disable the DCMI peripheral.
    (+) __HAL_DCMI_GET_FLAG: Get the DCMI pending flags.
    (+) __HAL_DCMI_CLEAR_FLAG: Clear the DCMI pending flags.
    (+) __HAL_DCMI_ENABLE_IT: Enable the specified DCMI interrupts.
    (+) __HAL_DCMI_DISABLE_IT: Disable the specified DCMI interrupts.
    (+) __HAL_DCMI_GET_IT_SOURCE: Check whether the specified DCMI interrupt has occurred or not.
