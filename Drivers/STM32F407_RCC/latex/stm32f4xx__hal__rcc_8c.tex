                    ##### RCC specific features #####
==============================================================================
  [..]  
    After reset the device is running from Internal High Speed oscillator 
    (HSI 16MHz) with Flash 0 wait state, Flash prefetch buffer, D-Cache 
    and I-Cache are disabled, and all peripherals are off except internal
    SRAM, Flash and JTAG.
    (+) There is no prescaler on High speed (AHB) and Low speed (APB) busses;
        all peripherals mapped on these busses are running at HSI speed.
    (+) The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
    (+) All GPIOs are in input floating state, except the JTAG pins which
        are assigned to be used for debug purpose.
  
  [..]          
    Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:        
    (+) Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
        (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
    (+) Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings  
    (+) Configure the AHB and APB busses prescalers
    (+) Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
    (+) Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals which clocks are not
        derived from the System clock (I2S, RTC, ADC, USB OTG FS/SDIO/RNG)

                    ##### RCC Limitations #####
==============================================================================
  [..]  
    A delay between an RCC peripheral clock enable and the effective peripheral 
    enabling should be taken into account in order to manage the peripheral read/write 
    from/to registers.
    (+) This delay depends on the peripheral mapping.
    (+) If peripheral is mapped on AHB: the delay is 2 AHB clock cycle 
        after the clock enable bit is set on the hardware register
    (+) If peripheral is mapped on APB: the delay is 2 APB clock cycle 
        after the clock enable bit is set on the hardware register

  [..]  
    Implemented Workaround:
    (+) For AHB & APB peripherals, a dummy read to the peripheral register has been
        inserted in each __HAL_RCC_PPP_CLK_ENABLE() macro.\end{DoxyVerb}
