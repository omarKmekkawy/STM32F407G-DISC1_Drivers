                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================       
  [..]
    This driver is a generic layered driver which contains a set of APIs used to 
    control NOR flash memories. It uses the FMC/FSMC layer functions to interface 
    with NOR devices. This driver is used as follows:
  
    (+) NOR flash memory configuration sequence using the function HAL_NOR_Init() 
        with control and timing parameters for both normal and extended mode.
          
    (+) Read NOR flash memory manufacturer code and device IDs using the function
        HAL_NOR_Read_ID(). The read information is stored in the NOR_ID_TypeDef 
        structure declared by the function caller. 
      
    (+) Access NOR flash memory by read/write data unit operations using the functions
        HAL_NOR_Read(), HAL_NOR_Program().
      
    (+) Perform NOR flash erase block/chip operations using the functions 
        HAL_NOR_Erase_Block() and HAL_NOR_Erase_Chip().
      
    (+) Read the NOR flash CFI (common flash interface) IDs using the function
        HAL_NOR_Read_CFI(). The read information is stored in the NOR_CFI_TypeDef
        structure declared by the function caller.
      
    (+) You can also control the NOR device by calling the control APIs HAL_NOR_WriteOperation_Enable()/
        HAL_NOR_WriteOperation_Disable() to respectively enable/disable the NOR write operation  
     
    (+) You can monitor the NOR device HAL state by calling the function
        HAL_NOR_GetState() 
  [..]
   (@) This driver is a set of generic APIs which handle standard NOR flash operations.
       If a NOR flash device contains different operations and/or implementations, 
       it should be implemented separately.
