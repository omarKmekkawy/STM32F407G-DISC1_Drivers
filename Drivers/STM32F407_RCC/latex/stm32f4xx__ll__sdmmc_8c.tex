06-\/May-\/2016 \begin{DoxyVerb}     This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
     functionalities of the SDMMC peripheral:
      + Initialization/de-initialization functions
      + I/O operation functions
      + Peripheral Control functions 
      + Peripheral State functions
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                     ##### SDMMC peripheral features #####
==============================================================================        
  [..] The SD/SDIO MMC card host interface (SDIO) provides an interface between the APB2
       peripheral bus and MultiMedia cards (MMCs), SD memory cards, SDIO cards and CE-ATA
       devices.

  [..] The SDIO features include the following:
       (+) Full compliance with MultiMedia Card System Specification Version 4.2. Card support
           for three different databus modes: 1-bit (default), 4-bit and 8-bit
       (+) Full compatibility with previous versions of MultiMedia Cards (forward compatibility)
       (+) Full compliance with SD Memory Card Specifications Version 2.0
       (+) Full compliance with SD I/O Card Specification Version 2.0: card support for two
           different data bus modes: 1-bit (default) and 4-bit
       (+) Full support of the CE-ATA features (full compliance with CE-ATA digital protocol
           Rev1.1)
       (+) Data transfer up to 48 MHz for the 8 bit mode
       (+) Data and command output enable signals to control external bidirectional drivers.
               
 
                         ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
    This driver is a considered as a driver of service for external devices drivers 
    that interfaces with the SDIO peripheral.
    According to the device used (SD card/ MMC card / SDIO card ...), a set of APIs 
    is used in the device's driver to perform SDIO operations and functionalities.
 
    This driver is almost transparent for the final user, it is only used to implement other
    functionalities of the external device.
 
  [..]
    (+) The SDIO clock (SDIOCLK = 48 MHz) is coming from a specific output of PLL 
        (PLL48CLK). Before start working with SDIO peripheral make sure that the
        PLL is well configured.
        The SDIO peripheral uses two clock signals:
        (++) SDIO adapter clock (SDIOCLK = 48 MHz)
        (++) APB2 bus clock (PCLK2)
     
        -@@- PCLK2 and SDIO_CK clock frequencies must respect the following condition:
             Frequency(PCLK2) >= (3 / 8 x Frequency(SDIO_CK))

    (+) Enable/Disable peripheral clock using RCC peripheral macros related to SDIO
        peripheral.

    (+) Enable the Power ON State using the SDIO_PowerState_ON(SDIOx) 
        function and disable it using the function SDIO_PowerState_OFF(SDIOx).
              
    (+) Enable/Disable the clock using the __SDIO_ENABLE()/__SDIO_DISABLE() macros.

    (+) Enable/Disable the peripheral interrupts using the macros __SDIO_ENABLE_IT(hsdio, IT) 
        and __SDIO_DISABLE_IT(hsdio, IT) if you need to use interrupt mode. 

    (+) When using the DMA mode 
        (++) Configure the DMA in the MSP layer of the external device
        (++) Active the needed channel Request 
        (++) Enable the DMA using __SDIO_DMA_ENABLE() macro or Disable it using the macro
             __SDIO_DMA_DISABLE().

    (+) To control the CPSM (Command Path State Machine) and send 
        commands to the card use the SDIO_SendCommand(SDIOx), 
        SDIO_GetCommandResponse() and SDIO_GetResponse() functions. First, user has
        to fill the command structure (pointer to SDIO_CmdInitTypeDef) according 
        to the selected command to be sent.
        The parameters that should be filled are:
         (++) Command Argument
         (++) Command Index
         (++) Command Response type
         (++) Command Wait
         (++) CPSM Status (Enable or Disable).

        -@@- To check if the command is well received, read the SDIO_CMDRESP
            register using the SDIO_GetCommandResponse().
            The SDIO responses registers (SDIO_RESP1 to SDIO_RESP2), use the
            SDIO_GetResponse() function.

    (+) To control the DPSM (Data Path State Machine) and send/receive 
         data to/from the card use the SDIO_DataConfig(), SDIO_GetDataCounter(), 
        SDIO_ReadFIFO(), DIO_WriteFIFO() and SDIO_GetFIFOCount() functions.

  *** Read Operations ***
  =======================
  [..]
    (#) First, user has to fill the data structure (pointer to
        SDIO_DataInitTypeDef) according to the selected data type to be received.
        The parameters that should be filled are:
         (++) Data Timeout
         (++) Data Length
         (++) Data Block size
         (++) Data Transfer direction: should be from card (To SDIO)
         (++) Data Transfer mode
         (++) DPSM Status (Enable or Disable)
                                   
    (#) Configure the SDIO resources to receive the data from the card
        according to selected transfer mode (Refer to Step 8, 9 and 10).

    (#) Send the selected Read command (refer to step 11).
                  
    (#) Use the SDIO flags/interrupts to check the transfer status.
