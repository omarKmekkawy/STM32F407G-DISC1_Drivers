                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
    The RNG HAL driver can be used as follows:

    (#) Enable the RNG controller clock using __HAL_RCC_RNG_CLK_ENABLE() macro 
        in HAL_RNG_MspInit().
    (#) Activate the RNG peripheral using HAL_RNG_Init() function.
    (#) Wait until the 32 bit Random Number Generator contains a valid 
        random data using (polling/interrupt) mode.   
    (#) Get the 32 bit random number using HAL_RNG_GenerateRandomNumber() function.\end{DoxyVerb}
