\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]            
    (#) Enable the CAN controller interface clock using 
        __HAL_RCC_CAN1_CLK_ENABLE() for CAN1 and __HAL_RCC_CAN2_CLK_ENABLE() for CAN2
    -@- In case you are using CAN2 only, you have to enable the CAN1 clock.
     
    (#) CAN pins configuration
      (++) Enable the clock for the CAN GPIOs using the following function:
           __GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE()   
      (++) Connect and configure the involved CAN pins to AF9 using the 
            following function HAL_GPIO_Init() 
            
    (#) Initialize and configure the CAN using CAN_Init() function.   
               
    (#) Transmit the desired CAN frame using HAL_CAN_Transmit() function.
         
    (#) Receive a CAN frame using HAL_CAN_Receive() function.

   *** Polling mode IO operation ***
   =================================
   [..]    
     (+) Start the CAN peripheral transmission and wait the end of this operation 
         using HAL_CAN_Transmit(), at this stage user can specify the value of timeout
         according to his end application
     (+) Start the CAN peripheral reception and wait the end of this operation 
         using HAL_CAN_Receive(), at this stage user can specify the value of timeout
         according to his end application 
     
   *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***    
   ===================================
   [..]    
     (+) Start the CAN peripheral transmission using HAL_CAN_Transmit_IT()
     (+) Start the CAN peripheral reception using HAL_CAN_Receive_IT()         
     (+) Use HAL_CAN_IRQHandler() called under the used CAN Interrupt subroutine
     (+) At CAN end of transmission HAL_CAN_TxCpltCallback() function is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_CAN_TxCpltCallback 
     (+) In case of CAN Error, HAL_CAN_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
          add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_CAN_ErrorCallback

   *** CAN HAL driver macros list ***
   ============================================= 
   [..]
     Below the list of most used macros in CAN HAL driver.
     
    (+) __HAL_CAN_ENABLE_IT: Enable the specified CAN interrupts
    (+) __HAL_CAN_DISABLE_IT: Disable the specified CAN interrupts
    (+) __HAL_CAN_GET_IT_SOURCE: Check if the specified CAN interrupt source is enabled or disabled
    (+) __HAL_CAN_CLEAR_FLAG: Clear the CAN's pending flags
    (+) __HAL_CAN_GET_FLAG: Get the selected CAN's flag status
    
   [..] 
    (@) You can refer to the CAN HAL driver header file for more useful macros \end{DoxyVerb}
