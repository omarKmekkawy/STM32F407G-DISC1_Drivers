                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
    The LPTIM HAL driver can be used as follows:

    (#)Initialize the LPTIM low level resources by implementing the
      HAL_LPTIM_MspInit():
       (##) Enable the LPTIM interface clock using __LPTIMx_CLK_ENABLE().
       (##) In case of using interrupts (e.g. HAL_LPTIM_PWM_Start_IT()):
           (+++) Configure the LPTIM interrupt priority using HAL_NVIC_SetPriority().
           (+++) Enable the LPTIM IRQ handler using HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ().
           (+++) In LPTIM IRQ handler, call HAL_LPTIM_IRQHandler().

    (#)Initialize the LPTIM HAL using HAL_LPTIM_Init(). This function
       configures mainly:
       (##) The instance: LPTIM1.
       (##) Clock: the counter clock.
           (+++) Source   : it can be either the ULPTIM input (IN1) or one of
                            the internal clock; (APB, LSE or LSI).
           (+++) Prescaler: select the clock divider.
       (##)  UltraLowPowerClock : To be used only if the ULPTIM is selected
             as counter clock source.
           (+++) Polarity:   polarity of the active edge for the counter unit
                             if the ULPTIM input is selected.
           (+++) SampleTime: clock sampling time to configure the clock glitch
                             filter.              
       (##) Trigger: How the counter start.
           (+++) Source: trigger can be software or one of the hardware triggers.
           (+++) ActiveEdge : only for hardware trigger.
           (+++) SampleTime : trigger sampling time to configure the trigger
                              glitch filter.
       (##) OutputPolarity : 2 opposite polarities are possibles.
       (##) UpdateMode: specifies whether the update of the autoreload and
            the compare values is done immediately or after the end of current
            period.   

    (#)Six modes are available:

       (##) PWM Mode: To generate a PWM signal with specified period and pulse,
       call HAL_LPTIM_PWM_Start() or HAL_LPTIM_PWM_Start_IT() for interruption
       mode.

       (##) One Pulse Mode: To generate pulse with specified width in response
       to a stimulus, call HAL_LPTIM_OnePulse_Start() or
       HAL_LPTIM_OnePulse_Start_IT() for interruption mode.

       (##) Set once Mode: In this mode, the output changes the level (from
       low level to high level if the output polarity is configured high, else
       the opposite) when a compare match occurs. To start this mode, call 
       HAL_LPTIM_SetOnce_Start() or HAL_LPTIM_SetOnce_Start_IT() for
       interruption mode.

       (##) Encoder Mode: To use the encoder interface call
       HAL_LPTIM_Encoder_Start() or HAL_LPTIM_Encoder_Start_IT() for 
       interruption mode.

       (##) Time out Mode: an active edge on one selected trigger input rests
       the counter. The first trigger event will start the timer, any
       successive trigger event will reset the counter and the timer will
       restart. To start this mode call HAL_LPTIM_TimeOut_Start_IT() or 
       HAL_LPTIM_TimeOut_Start_IT() for interruption mode.

       (##) Counter Mode: counter can be used to count external events on
       the LPTIM Input1 or it can be used to count internal clock cycles.
       To start this mode, call HAL_LPTIM_Counter_Start() or 
       HAL_LPTIM_Counter_Start_IT() for interruption mode.

    (#) User can stop any process by calling the corresponding API:
        HAL_LPTIM_Xxx_Stop() or HAL_LPTIM_Xxx_Stop_IT() if the process is
        already started in interruption mode.

     (#)Call HAL_LPTIM_DeInit() to deinitialize the LPTIM peripheral.\end{DoxyVerb}
