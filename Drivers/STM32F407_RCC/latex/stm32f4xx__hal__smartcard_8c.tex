                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
    The SMARTCARD HAL driver can be used as follows:
  
  (#) Declare a SMARTCARD_HandleTypeDef handle structure.
  (#) Initialize the SMARTCARD low level resources by implementing the HAL_SMARTCARD_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the USARTx interface clock.
      (##) SMARTCARD pins configuration:
          (+++) Enable the clock for the SMARTCARD GPIOs.
          (+++) Configure these SMARTCARD pins as alternate function pull-up.
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_SMARTCARD_Transmit_IT()
           and HAL_SMARTCARD_Receive_IT() APIs):
          (+++) Configure the USARTx interrupt priority.
          (+++) Enable the NVIC USART IRQ handle.
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_SMARTCARD_Transmit_DMA()
           and HAL_SMARTCARD_Receive_DMA() APIs):
          (+++) Declare a DMA handle structure for the Tx/Rx stream.
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock.
          (+++) Configure the declared DMA handle structure with the required Tx/Rx parameters.                
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the SMARTCARD DMA Tx/Rx handle.
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on the DMA Tx/Rx Stream.

  (#) Program the Baud Rate, Word Length , Stop Bit, Parity, Hardware 
      flow control and Mode(Receiver/Transmitter) in the SMARTCARD Init structure.

  (#) Initialize the SMARTCARD registers by calling the HAL_SMARTCARD_Init() API:
      (++) These APIs configure also the low level Hardware GPIO, CLOCK, CORTEX...etc)
           by calling the customized HAL_SMARTCARD_MspInit() API.
  [..]  
  (@) The specific SMARTCARD interrupts (Transmission complete interrupt, 
      RXNE interrupt and Error Interrupts) will be managed using the macros
      __HAL_SMARTCARD_ENABLE_IT() and __HAL_SMARTCARD_DISABLE_IT() inside the transmit and receive process.
                 
  [..]   
  Three operation modes are available within this driver :     

  *** Polling mode IO operation ***
  =================================
  [..]    
    (+) Send an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_SMARTCARD_Transmit() 
    (+) Receive an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_SMARTCARD_Receive()
     
  *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***    
  ===================================
  [..]    
    (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_SMARTCARD_Transmit_IT() 
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_SMARTCARD_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SMARTCARD_TxCpltCallback
    (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode using HAL_SMARTCARD_Receive_IT() 
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_SMARTCARD_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SMARTCARD_RxCpltCallback
    (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_SMARTCARD_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SMARTCARD_ErrorCallback

  *** DMA mode IO operation ***    
  ==============================
  [..] 
    (+) Send an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_SMARTCARD_Transmit_DMA() 
    (+) At transmission end of transfer HAL_SMARTCARD_TxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SMARTCARD_TxCpltCallback
    (+) Receive an amount of data in non blocking mode (DMA) using HAL_SMARTCARD_Receive_DMA() 
    (+) At reception end of transfer HAL_SMARTCARD_RxCpltCallback is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SMARTCARD_RxCpltCallback
    (+) In case of transfer Error, HAL_SMARTCARD_ErrorCallback() function is executed and user can 
        add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_SMARTCARD_ErrorCallback    

  *** SMARTCARD HAL driver macros list ***
  ============================================= 
  [..]
    Below the list of most used macros in SMARTCARD HAL driver.
     
    (+) __HAL_SMARTCARD_ENABLE: Enable the SMARTCARD peripheral 
    (+) __HAL_SMARTCARD_DISABLE: Disable the SMARTCARD peripheral     
    (+) __HAL_SMARTCARD_GET_FLAG : Check whether the specified SMARTCARD flag is set or not
    (+) __HAL_SMARTCARD_CLEAR_FLAG : Clear the specified SMARTCARD pending flag
    (+) __HAL_SMARTCARD_ENABLE_IT: Enable the specified SMARTCARD interrupt
    (+) __HAL_SMARTCARD_DISABLE_IT: Disable the specified SMARTCARD interrupt
