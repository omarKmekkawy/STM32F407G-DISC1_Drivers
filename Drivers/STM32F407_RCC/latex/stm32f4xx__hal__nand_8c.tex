                       ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================    
  [..]
    This driver is a generic layered driver which contains a set of APIs used to 
    control NAND flash memories. It uses the FMC/FSMC layer functions to interface 
    with NAND devices. This driver is used as follows:
  
    (+) NAND flash memory configuration sequence using the function HAL_NAND_Init() 
        with control and timing parameters for both common and attribute spaces.
          
    (+) Read NAND flash memory maker and device IDs using the function
        HAL_NAND_Read_ID(). The read information is stored in the NAND_ID_TypeDef 
        structure declared by the function caller. 
      
    (+) Access NAND flash memory by read/write operations using the functions
        HAL_NAND_Read_Page()/HAL_NAND_Read_SpareArea(), HAL_NAND_Write_Page()/HAL_NAND_Write_SpareArea()
        to read/write page(s)/spare area(s). These functions use specific device 
        information (Block, page size..) predefined by the user in the HAL_NAND_Info_TypeDef 
        structure. The read/write address information is contained by the Nand_Address_Typedef
        structure passed as parameter.
      
    (+) Perform NAND flash Reset chip operation using the function HAL_NAND_Reset().
      
    (+) Perform NAND flash erase block operation using the function HAL_NAND_Erase_Block().
        The erase block address information is contained in the Nand_Address_Typedef 
        structure passed as parameter.
  
    (+) Read the NAND flash status operation using the function HAL_NAND_Read_Status().
      
    (+) You can also control the NAND device by calling the control APIs HAL_NAND_ECC_Enable()/
        HAL_NAND_ECC_Disable() to respectively enable/disable the ECC code correction
        feature or the function HAL_NAND_GetECC() to get the ECC correction code. 
     
    (+) You can monitor the NAND device HAL state by calling the function
        HAL_NAND_GetState()  

  [..]
    (@) This driver is a set of generic APIs which handle standard NAND flash operations.
        If a NAND flash device contains different operations and/or implementations, 
        it should be implemented separately.\end{DoxyVerb}
