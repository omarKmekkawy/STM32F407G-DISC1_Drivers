## Getting Started
In this repository, I will create drivers for the STM32F407G-DISC1 board.

## Drivers
The drivers will be MCAL ( Microcontroller Abstraction Layer ) and HAL ( Hardware Abstraction Layer )
### MCAL
This will contains all the peripherals drivers
#### Core Peripherals:
* NVIC ( Semi completed, NMI not completed yet ).
* SYSTICK ( Completed ).
* SCB ( On progress ).
* 
#### Other Peripherals:
* RCC ( On progress ).
* DIO & AFIO ( Completed ).
* SYSCFG ( On progress ).
* EXTI ( Completed ).
* 

### HAL
This will contains all the Drivers for the interfaced hardware with the microcontroller
*
