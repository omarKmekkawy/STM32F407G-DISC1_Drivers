## Getting Started
In this repository, I will create drivers for the STM32F407G-DISC1 board.

## Drivers
The drivers will be MCAL ( Microcontroller Abstraction Layer ) and HAL ( Hardware Abstraction Layer )
### MCAL
This will contains all the peripherals drivers
* RCC ( On progress ).
* DIO & AFIO ( Completed ).
* SCB ( On progress ).
* SYSCFG ( On progress ).
* 

### HAL
This will contains all the Drivers for the interfaced hardware with the microcontroller
*
